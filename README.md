# PISA 2012 - Data Analysis
## by Sudarsana Rajarathnam


## PISA 2012 Overview

PISA is the OECD's Programme for International Student Assessment. Every three years it tests 15 year old students from all over the world in Reading, Mathematics and Science. The tests are designed to gauge how well the students master key subjects in order to be prepared for real-life situations in the adult world. This is not a conventional school test. Rather than examining how well students have learned the school curriculum, it looks at how well prepared they are for life beyond school.
Our data comprises of 485,490 students from 65 economies who took part in the PISA 2012 assessment of Reading, Mathematics and Science representing about 31.5 million 15-year-olds globally.  


## Summary of Findings

* Mexico is topping the list with the maximum number of students appearing for PISA 2012, followed closely by Italy and then by Spain, Canada and Brazil. 
* The maximum number of students score between the range of 400-500 in all the three subjects followed by the second maximum number of students scoring between the 500-600 range.The highest scores of 700 and above are scored by only very few students. 
* China-Shanghai is home to the highest Math scorers in the world at PISA 2012, followed by Chinese Taipei, Singapore and Korea thereby highlighting the East-Asian talent.
* Singapore is the Top Performing Country in Science followed by and Australia.
* Singapore again has bagged the Top Performing Country in Reading; this time it's followed by Japan.
* Mexico, with the maximum number of students, is clearly seen to have more Girls appearing for the test compared to Boys. Canada, Brazil and Columbia have a higher Female to Male ratio while Italy, Australia and Qatar have lower Female to Male ratio.
* Students with Parent Origin from Different countries have scored better in the PISA 2012 test compared to those whose Parent's Origin are from the Same country.
* The Avg Math Score, Avg Science Score and Avg Reading Score columns show a high positive correlation between each other.
* Girls lead Boys worldwide in Reading Scores.
* Boys clearly lead Girls worldwide in Math Scores, except in Singapore.
* Boys lead Girls or scored similar in Science Scores, except in Singapore and Finland.
* Girls from Singapore lead in performance in all the three subjects worldwide.


## Key Insights for Presentation

My Presentation includes eight Visualizations of Explanatory Analysis. Here are the Key Insights that let me chose the path I took:

* While I observed my Univariate Explorations of Country vs Student Count, I was sure I was going to explore the addition of a Gender variable to it in my Bivariate Explorations. I was also able to extend the same into a Multivariate plot where I have developed a Visulization for Gender wise distribution of Students who are the Top Performers Worldwide including their respective Countries. I have rendered the Multivariate Plots in my Visualization 8 of the Slide Show.

* When I observed my Univariate Explorations of Average Scores vs Student Count, I was interested to see the relationship between the 3 Average Subject Scores and Gender which I have rendered in my Visualization 7 of the Slide Show.

* When I observed my Univariate Explorations of the Top Performing Countries in all the three subjects, I was interested in knowing whether there were students who performed well in two subjects at a time, which led to my Bivariate Exploration. This in turn asked me to check the correlation between all the three average subject scores themselves creating the Heatmap in Visualization 6 of the Slide Show.


## Feedback

* My Spouse helped me in correcting the appearance of Explanatory Plot Visualizations including some color encodings. I incorporated  the changes into my final Slide Show.
